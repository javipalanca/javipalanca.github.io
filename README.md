## 🔄 GitHub Pages Integration

This project is set up for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages:

- **GitHub Actions Workflow**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` handles automatic deployment
- **Astro Config**: `astro.config.mjs` is configured for GitHub Pages
- **No Base Path**: Site is deployed at the root level of the GitHub Pages domain

### Deployment Process

1. Changes pushed to the `main` branch trigger the GitHub Actions workflow
2. The workflow builds the Astro site and deploys it to GitHub Pages
3. The site is automatically published at the configured URL

### Local Development

To develop the website locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview the production build
npm run preview
```
