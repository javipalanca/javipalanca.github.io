# Syntax Highlighting - FIXED! ✅

## Problem Resolved

The Python code blocks in the Astro website now have proper syntax highlighting with colors applied.

## Root Cause

The issue was that our custom CSS was overriding the Prism.js theme colors with `!important`
declarations, preventing the Okaidia theme from applying its colorization.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Changed Prism.js Theme

- **Before**: Basic `prism.min.css` (no colors)
- **After**: `prism-okaidia.min.css` (dark theme with syntax colors)

### 2. Removed CSS Overrides in BaseLayout.astro

- Removed `!important` color overrides that were blocking Prism colors
- Kept only basic container styling (borders, font-size, etc.)
- Let Prism.js handle all syntax highlighting colors

### 3. Cleaned Up PythonCodeBlock.astro

- Removed all custom token color definitions
- Removed background color overrides
- Kept only structural styling (headers, copy buttons, responsive design)

### 4. Removed Test Example

- Removed the "Direct Prism.js Test" example that was showing as illegible white text

## Current Implementation

### BaseLayout.astro

```html
<!-- Prism.js with Okaidia theme -->
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prism/1.29.0/themes/prism-okaidia.min.css"
/>

<!-- Scripts -->
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prism/1.29.0/prism.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prism/1.29.0/components/prism-python.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prism/1.29.0/components/prism-bash.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prism/1.29.0/components/prism-yaml.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prism/1.29.0/components/prism-json.min.js"></script>
```

### PythonCodeBlock.astro

- Clean component focused on structure and functionality
- No color overrides - lets Prism.js handle syntax highlighting
- Includes copy functionality and responsive design
- Header with Python emoji and filename display

## Features Working

- ✅ Python syntax highlighting with proper colors
- ✅ Keywords, strings, functions, comments, decorators all colorized
- ✅ Copy-to-clipboard functionality
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Clean component structure
- ✅ Production build compatibility
- ✅ No illegible test content

## Files Modified

- `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` - Changed CSS theme, removed color overrides
- `src/components/PythonCodeBlock.astro` - Removed custom syntax colors
- `src/pages/index.astro` - Removed test example

## Verification

- ✅ Development server: http://localhost:4321/ - syntax highlighting visible
- ✅ Production build: `npm run build` - successful
- ✅ All 3 Python code examples showing proper colorization
- ✅ Okaidia theme colors applied (orange strings, blue keywords, etc.)

## Next Steps

The syntax highlighting implementation is now complete and working properly. The code blocks display
with professional syntax highlighting using the Okaidia theme colors.
